# WebEngDUS

Everything you need to know about how we run the *Web Engineering DUS Meetup*.

## Location Sponsor / Location and Company Briefing

The *Web Engineering DUS Meetup* depends on the support of local companies.
Local companies can sponsor the meetup by providing us with a location, technical equipment, and some food and drinks during the meetup.

For consistent communication and expectation management, we provide everything you, as a company, need to know about sponsoring and hosting a WebEngDUS meetup event:

## Code of Conduct

[Checkout the Code of Conduct for our events](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Raffle

From time to time, we do a raffle.
The raffle price will be (most of the time) provided by various sponsors.
Prices we had in the past:

* power banks (e.g. to recharge your phone)
* programing language mascots (e.g. [ElePHPant](https://www.php.net/elephpant.php))
* conference tickets

To select a winner, we assume that everyone signed up via the meetup event page.
We open the event page, open the developer console of the browser and use the following javascript snippet to select a winner:

"going" only
```js
// only "going"
var a=document.querySelectorAll('.attendees-list li.attendee-item'), b=a[Math.floor((Math.random()*a.length)+1)-1];
a.forEach(function(e){e.style='';});
b.style='border: 7px dotted red;';
b.scrollIntoView({behavior:'smooth'});
```

The raffle script code was written by [@SHyx0rmZ](https://github.com/SHyx0rmZ).
