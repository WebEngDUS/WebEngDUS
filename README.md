# WebEngDUS

Everything you need to know about how we run the *Web Engineering DUS Meetup*.

## Checklists

Organizing and running the *Web Engineering DUS Meetup* is getting more and more complex.
To make our live easier we follow simple checklists.

[Checkout our Checklists](./CHECKLISTS.md).

## Meetup templates

A template for a new event at Meetup.com is described in [MEETUP.md](./MEETUP.md).

## Assets (Logo, Presentation, etc.)

All our assets can be found in the [*Assets*-Folder](./Assets). This includes:

- our colour scheme
- our logo in various formats and variants
- the design of our beach flag
- a Keynote template
- a DINA4 template

### Font

The font _Gotham HTF_ was used.

### Credit

All assets were created by [Fabian Huettenhoff](https://twitter.com/zuqbu). A **big** Thank you for this!

## Code of Conduct

[Checkout the Code of Conduct for our events](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Raffle

From time to time, we do a raffle.
The raffle price will be (most of the time) provided by various sponsors.
Prices we had in the past:

* power banks (e.g. to recharge your phone)
* programing language mascots (e.g. [ElePHPant](https://www.php.net/elephpant.php))
* conference tickets

To select a winner, we assume that everyone signed up on the meetup event page.
We open the event page, open the developer console of the browser and use the following javascript snippets to select a winner:

"going" only
```js
// only "going"
var a=document.querySelectorAll('.attendees-list li.attendee-item'), b=a[Math.floor((Math.random()*a.length)+1)-1];
a.forEach(function(e){e.style='';});
b.style='border: 7px dotted red;';
b.scrollIntoView({behavior:'smooth'});
```

The raffle script code was written by [@SHyx0rmZ](https://github.com/SHyx0rmZ).
