# Code Of Conduct

## 1. Need Help?

Please tweet/DM us at [@WebEngDus](https://twitter.com/WebEngDus), send us a message via [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Web-Engineering-Duesseldorf/), or talk to us directly during the [events](https://www.meetup.com/Web-Engineering-Duesseldorf/).

## 2. Principles

We are committed to providing a harassment-free, friendly, and welcoming environment for everyone.
If you are being harassed or have any other concerns, please get in touch with a member of the organization team.
We expect every member to follow these rules at all events and in our online community.

## 3. Recruiting and Advertising

Participants are asked to refrain from advertising and recruiting activities during the events or online.
We understand that demand for software engineers dramatically outstrips supply, and allowing recruiting through our events or in online communication would reduce the quality of the community and its discussions.
Speakers at our events are welcome to mention their upcoming product launch, their startup idea, or that their company is hiring, as long as it is kept short and the focus remains on the content of their talk.
